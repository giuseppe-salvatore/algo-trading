# The Simple Scalping Strategy #

## Summary ##
The simple scalping strategy consists in taking positions in equities that have high volatility and can make sudden changes (we are looking at least 2-3%) and exit from those positions in a very short amount of time, once the upward or downard trend is exausted.

## Charts and Indicators ##
We are going to be using 1 and 5 minutes candles charts to analyse the entry/exit to/from the positions
- 5 periods exp moving avg
- Bollinger Bands
- RSI

## Analysis and Actions ##
- Analyse the chart on 5 mins period and trade on 1 min period
