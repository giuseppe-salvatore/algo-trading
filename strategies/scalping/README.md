<h1>The Simple Scalping Strategy</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>
The simple scalping strategy consists in taking positions in equities that have high volatility and can make sudden changes (we are looking at least 2-3%) and exit from those positions in a very short amount of time, once the upward or downard trend is exausted.
